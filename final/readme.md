# Tea Mood Visualizer: Understanding Tea's Emotional Landscape

## Overview

The Mooder system is an innovative approach to analyzing and visualizing the emotional and sensory characteristics of tea. By combining scientific metrics with nuanced mood profiling, this system provides a holistic understanding of how different teas can influence mental and emotional states.

## Core Concepts

### Mood Calculation Methodology

The mood calculation is a multi-dimensional process that considers several key factors:

1. **Tea Type Base Scores**
   - Each tea type has inherent mood characteristics
   - Examples:
     - Green Tea: Emphasizes calming and harmonizing qualities
     - Black Tea: Focuses on energizing and warming properties
     - Herbal Tea: Prioritizes serene and cozy experiences

2. **Caffeine and L-Theanine Analysis**
   - Caffeine levels contribute to energy and stimulation
   - L-Theanine levels influence relaxation and mental clarity
   - The interaction between these compounds creates a unique mood profile

### Data Structure Requirements

A tea object should have the following structure:

```javascript
{
  name: string,               // Name of the tea
  type: string,               // Tea type (green, black, oolong, etc.)
  caffeineLevel: number,      // 0-10 scale of caffeine content
  lTheanineLevel: number,     // 0-10 scale of L-Theanine content
  flavorProfile: string[],    // Array of flavor descriptors
  processingMethods: string[] // Array of processing method descriptors
}
```

## Mood Calculation Process

### 1. Base Score Determination

The system starts by assigning base scores to different mood categories based on tea type:

```javascript
function getTypeBaseScores(type) {
  const scores = {
    energizing: 0,
    calming: 0,
    serene: 0,
    // ... other mood categories
  };

  switch(type.toLowerCase()) {
    case 'green':
      scores.calming = 2;
      scores.harmonizing = 1.5;
      break;
    // ... other tea type mappings
  }
  
  return scores;
}
```

### 2. Caffeine and L-Theanine Influence

Compounds are categorized and their interaction is analyzed:

```javascript
function calculateCompoundEffect(caffeineLevel, lTheanineLevel) {
  const ratio = lTheanineLevel / caffeineLevel;
  
  return {
    calming: ratio >= 2 ? 2 : ratio,
    energizing: ratio < 1 ? 2 : 1/ratio,
    harmonizing: ratio >= 1.5 && ratio <= 2.5 ? 2 : 0
  };
}
```

### 3. Flavor Profile Analysis

Flavors are mapped to mood categories with intensity scores:

```javascript
const flavorMoodCorrelations = {
  floral: {
    white_floral: {
      moods: ['serene', 'harmonizing', 'calming'],
      intensity: 2.5,
      flavors: ['jasmine', 'lilac', 'gardenia']
    }
    // ... other flavor subcategories
  }
}
```

### 4. Processing Method Influence

Processing methods contribute additional mood nuances:

```javascript
const processingMethodMoodAlignment = {
  'steamed': {
    moods: ['calming', 'harmonizing', 'serene'],
    intensity: 1.7,
    category: 'heat'
  }
  // ... other processing methods
}
```

## Mood Scoring Algorithm

The final mood score is calculated by:
1. Adding base type scores
2. Incorporating caffeine/L-Theanine compound effects
3. Analyzing flavor profile contributions
4. Considering processing method influences
5. Normalizing scores to a 0-10 range

### Example Mood Calculation

```javascript
function calculateTeaMood(tea) {
  // Initialize scores from tea type
  const scores = getTypeBaseScores(tea.type);
  
  // Add caffeine and L-theanine influences
  const levels = categorizeLevels(tea.caffeineLevel, tea.lTheanineLevel);
  const compounds = calculateCompoundEffect(tea.caffeineLevel, tea.lTheanineLevel);
  
  // Add flavor and processing method influences
  const flavorScores = calculateFlavorMoodInfluence(tea.flavorProfile);
  const processingScores = calculateProcessingInfluence(tea.processingMethods);
  
  // Combine and normalize scores
  // ... (detailed normalization logic)
  
  return {
    primary: { 
      type: 'primaryMoodType', 
      title: 'Primary Mood Title', 
      description: 'Mood description',
      score: 7 // 0-10 score
    },
    secondary: { /* Similar structure */ },
    allScores: { /* Detailed mood category scores */ }
  };
}
```

## Mood Categories

The system recognizes nine primary mood categories:
1. Energizing
2. Calming
3. Serene
4. Cozy
5. Meditative
6. Harmonizing
7. Contemplative
8. Invigorating
9. Warming

## Advanced Features

- Seasonal Mood Correlation
- Mood Pairing Suggestions
- Mood Complexity Analysis

## Limitations and Considerations

- Scores are interpretative and based on generalized correlations
- Individual experiences may vary
- The system provides a nuanced but not definitive mood prediction

## Contribution and Expansion

The Mooder system is designed to be extensible. Researchers and tea enthusiasts can:
- Add new flavor profiles
- Introduce processing methods
- Refine mood category definitions
